Canon Shooter Game

Overview

The Canon Shooter Game is a fun and interactive game built using Unity and C#, where players use a cannon to launch animals at walls in an attempt to break them. The game features physics-based mechanics to simulate realistic projectile motion and collisions. Players must aim strategically to maximize the impact and efficiently break the walls.

This project utilizes public prefabs to handle game objects such as the cannon, animals, and destructible walls, allowing for easy customization and expansion. The objective is to break all walls using the least number of shots possible.
